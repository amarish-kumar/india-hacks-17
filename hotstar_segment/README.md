# Problem Statement

Determining the demographics of customers is one of the most key tasks in the advertising domain. Advertisers usually want to target customers based on demographic attributes. However, it is difficult to get demographic data from all the customers since that can add friction to the user experience.

At Hotstar, we have detailed information on all the content that customers watch, let’s call it “watch patterns” and we’d like to use this signal to fine tune demo-targeting.

We are seeking a machine learning based solution using which we can learn patterns from customers whose watch patterns are already known. In this competition, the task is to generate predictive models that can best capture the behaviour. Participants are free to use any open source external data.
